# ChatRoom
Code challenge for a job at Open Garden.

This is a chat room application I implemented as a code challenge for Open Garden.
It allows you to type chat messages and see all messages sent by other users.
If the app if offline, all messages are persisted to disk, then sent
when an internet connection is available.
